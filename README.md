# Description
- The project offers a set of utility predicates for list manipulation in Prolog. These predicates cover common tasks such as finding elements, identifying positions, deleting elements by index, checking properties, concatenating lists, and verifying if a list is a palindrome.

 # Features
- Check if an element is a member of a list
- Get the first, last, and penultimate elements of a list
- Delete an element by its position
- Calculate the length of a list
- Check if a list has an even length
- Concatenate two lists
- Check if a list is a palindrome
# How to Use
- To check if an element is in a list: member(Element, List).
- To get the first element: first(Element, List).
- To find the last element: last(Element, List).
- To delete an element by position: del_k(Element, List, Position, Result).
- To check if a list is a palindrome: palindrome(List).
# Installation
- Ensure Prolog is installed.
- Load the file in the Prolog interpreter and use the commands as shown.
